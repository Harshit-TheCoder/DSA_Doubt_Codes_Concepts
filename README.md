## An Odd Number has divisors all of which are odd.

--- 
## To break a number in 'k' parts of different powers of 2, i.e, num = 2^a + 2^b + 2^c + .... k times EXACTLY,
- it is possible only if number of set bits in num <= k <= num

---

## In terms of bits, a number num always lies between [ b^k , b^(k+1) -1 ]
- Eg, if base is 4 then [4^0, 4^(0+1) - 1] -> 0 - 3
- [4^1, 4^(1+1) - 1] -> 4 - 15
-  [4^2, 4^(2+1) - 1] -> 16 - 63 and so on

## XOR Basis Trick (Short Form)
    Purpose
    Represent all subset XORs compactly.
    Answer queries like max subset XOR, kth subset XOR, representability.
    Rules
    Insert Rule:
        For each number, reduce it with current basis (XOR out higher bits).
        If it becomes 0 → skip (dependent).
        Else put it in the basis at its MSB position.
        ✅ Reason: Ensures basis is linearly independent, like Gaussian elimination.
    Max XOR Rule:
        Start ans = 0.
        From high → low bits: if ans ^ basis[i] > ans, then do ans ^= basis[i].
        ✅ Reason: Always try to add higher-bit vectors if they increase the number.
    Representability Rule:
        To check if x is possible, reduce x using basis.
        If x ends as 0 → yes, else no.
        ✅ Reason: If x lies in the span of basis, it can be formed.
    Count Rule:
        If basis size = k, then number of distinct subset XORs = 2^k.
        ✅ Reason: Each basis element can be included or not, independently.
    Complexity
    Build basis: O(n · log(maxA))
    (Each number reduced by up to log(maxA) bits).
    Max XOR query: O(log(maxA))
    Representability check: O(log(maxA))
    Distinct count: just O(1) (2^k).

    for(int num: nums){
        for(int i=31;i>=0;i--){
            if((num & (1 << i)) == 0) continue;
            if(basis[i] == 0){
                basis[i] = num;
                break;
            }
            num ^= basis[i];
        }
    }

    int ans = 0;
    for(int i=31;i>=0;i--) ans = Math.max(ans, ans^basis[i]);

## If there are two arrays and an inuequality given or some relation to relate two arrays
- always combine the two arrays together using the inequality

--- 

## Difference Array Concept
 - For range updates, we can use difference arrays to precalculate the range in O(n) time.
 - int diff[] = new int[n]
 - diff[l] += 1, diff[r+1] -= -1

---

## Remove some occurences of one character to make string palindrome
    i = 0, j= n-1
    See if s[i] == s[j] do i++; j--;
    else removal of either s[i] or s[j] will make string palidrome else string cannot be palindrome.
    string 0...i-1 and j+1 .... n-1 is already palindrome, 
    between i and j ignore wherever s[i] == s[j]. 
    if s[i] != s[j] and both are not character to be removed then return false.
    else simulate removing the character using two pointers till i<=j.

---

## Jump Array Concept
    In an array, [a1, a2, a3, a4, .... an] you have two operations,
    1. move ahead to a strictly smaller element 
    2. move behind to a strictly greater element
    calculate prefix max, suffix min array, 
    now for each element, 
    start from i=n-2 to i = 0.
    1. p[i] > s[i + 1] then let x = p[i], y = s[i+1] then it is always possible i -> x -> y -> (i+1) then ans[i] = ans[i+1]
    2. p[i] <= s[i + 1] then no valid jump is possible so ans[i] = p[i]

---

## Decrease Array Concept
    let a = [a1, a2, a3, ......, an], you have to choose two ai , aj,  i not = j and decrease both 1 and ultimately see if array can be 0.
    here two conditions are,
    1. Array sum must be even because everytime we are decreasing sum by 2.
    2. Also the largest element M must be M <= S - M where S is sum because to make M 0 we need atleast M 1's among other elements

---

## If we are given 3 binary strings and we have to arrange them in a way such that we get maximum binary number,
- Always remember for 2 strings s and t, iff s + t > t + s,
- Do brute force for 3 strings and do above operation for all 6 permutations.

---

## Segment Problems
- When given an array of segments `[(l1, r1), (l2, r2), ... (ln, rn)]`,  
  **focus on their intersections**.
- Use a **difference array** or **difference map** to handle updates and queries over segments effectively.

---

## Trailing Zeroes in Numbers
- Trailing zeroes are determined by factors of **2** and **5**:
- If multiplying a number `k ≤ m` to maximize trailing zeroes:
1. Count the factors of 2 and 5 in `k`.
2. Balance them such that `count(2) = count(5)`.
3. Multiply by 10 until `k * 10 > m`.
4. Finally, maximize by multiplying with `m/k`.

---

## Making Numbers Equal by Adding Residuals
Transform `[p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w] → [a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a]`  
using remainder patterns of `x % 10`:

- **Cycles of residuals:**
- `0 → 0`
- `1 → 1, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `2 → 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `3 → 3,6, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `4 → 4,8,6, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `5 → 5,0`
- `6 → 6, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `7 → 7,4,8,6, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `8 → 8,6, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`
- `9 → 9,8,6, 2,4,8,6 ... cycle`

- To make all equal:
  Ensure `(p + residual(p % 10))` for all numbers gives the **same remainder**.  
The set of remainders must have **size 1**.

- Number of non overlapping segments is the answer

---

## GCD Trick
- To partition an array [a1,a2,a3,...., an] into subsegments such that gcd of all subsegments is maximum, then ans = max(ans, gcd(prefix[i], sum - prefix[i]))
- Optimal answer is array can be split into only 2 subsegments.
- Note gcd(b1, b2, b3, ...., bn) <= gcd(b1 + b2, b3, ..., bn) because if b1 and b2 are multiples of gcd 'd' then b1 + b2 is also a multiple of 'd'

--- 

### Sorting trick

---

## Subsequence sum of an array trick
- An array [a1, a2, a3...., an] is given having distinct numbers from 1 to n and size 'n'
- Smallest sum with first 'k' numbers = (k*(k+1)) / 2
- Largest sum with last 'k' numbers = k(2*n -k + 1) / 2
- A subsequence with a sum anything between this lowest and highest sum is possible.

---

## Array XOR Trick
- An array [a1, a2, a3...., an] is given.
- We have to take any segment of elements [l, r] and then XOR all elements in the range and replace all elements with this XOR value

- If n is odd, four operations required, [1, n], [2, n], [1, 2], [1, 2]

---

## GCD Trick

---

## Array Concept

## Longest Balanced Substring (a, b, c)

## Problem:
Find the length of the **longest balanced substring** of a string containing only `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`.  
A substring is **balanced** if all **distinct characters** in it appear the **same number of times**.
### Algorithm Summary:

1. **Prefix counts:**  
   - Maintain cumulative counts of `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'` at each index:
     ```
     a_i, b_i, c_i = counts in S[0..i-1]
     ```

2. **Key idea:**  
   - A substring `S[i..j]` is balanced if the differences between counts are the same at both ends.  
   - Use **differences** `(a-b, a-c)` as a key to identify balanced substrings.

3. **Hash Map:**  
   - Store the **first occurrence** of each key `(a-b, a-c)` in a map.  
   - When the same key appears again at index `j`, the substring from **first occurrence + 1 to j** is balanced.

4. **Update answer:**  
   - Length of balanced substring = `current_index - first_index_of_key`.  
   - Track the **maximum length** during the scan.

5. **Return** the maximum length after processing the string.


### Key Insight / Trick:
- Using `(a-b, a-c)` **automatically handles all cases**:
  1. Substrings with **all 3 characters**.  
  2. Substrings with **2 characters**.  
  3. Substrings with **1 character**.  
- Only **one map** is enough; no need for multiple keys or maps.

### Complexity:
- **Time:** O(n)  
- **Space:** O(n)
